    Is the game too easy or hard?
        The game is quite simple. In many of the instances while I was playing it, the balls pretty muct got to their corners with little or no help from me as the player. 
    
    What would make the game easier or harder?
        I dont think it needs to be easier, but it might be slighlty more difficult if the goals were only available for about 5 - 10 seconds at a time. This would make it so the player would have to focus on a single color and actually work to direct it into a goal. 

    What would give it a "wow" factor?
        Maybe having random effects pop up that if the yellow ball hits them cahnges the rules a littlee
            For instance: Having an "X" could drop a few exttra balls on the board.
                          A lighting bolt could cause the balls to speed up every time they bounce, ramping up for 3 - 5 seconds and then slowing down to normal speed over a similar period of time. 
                          A skull or "acme" style bomb could destroy/respawn all the balls an cause the player to start again without resetting the timer. 
                          Adding bricks, like in brick breaker games, which would surround the colored balls until the player uses the chaos ball to break them free. 

    What parts of the game are fun?
        The game is only fun because I put it together and understand what i was doing during that process.
        It is also not really tedious though, either. As previously mentioned, the player in many cases doesn't really even have to move. 
 


Additions I will be making (things that I need a little practice with)
-Adding a timer for the player to know how long it took to complete the game
        //Got a timer in placer
        //Still having a little trouble with understanding GUI set up

-Adding variations of the chaos balls: different sizes and speeds
        //Changed speeds of red, blue, green, and orange balls and change the size of the Chaos Ball

-Changing the size of the bumper
        //Made it longer

-Adding Terrain and other game objects
        //Added sand and trees. 

-Adding a play again button
        //I tried this, but got myself super confused and wound up recreating the game manager. 

Also I want to pull the camera back
