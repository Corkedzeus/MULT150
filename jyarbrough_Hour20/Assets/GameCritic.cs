1. Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.

I dont actually believe it's "too hard". However, I believe it can be a little difficult to 
move from one side to the other in time to obtain a powerup. Also, the phae modes seems to 
be a little long and the barriers sometimes spawn too close together. 


2. What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

As stated I don't find it particularly hard, nor do I find it simple. 
So these are some of the things i would consider to bring balance to the game. 

    a. I would like to have a small area that the player model can move forward and back,
       not just left to right. 
      
    b. I would make adjustments to the run speed when running forward and backwards as 
       well as adjusting the strafe speed. 

    c. I think a separate ability, like jumping or rollong, could be fun. This would require
       new animations (potentially available on Mixamo). 
      

3. List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
    
    a. Having boost that is stored up vs just adding time to the timer; so an additional powerup.

    b. A good Heads-Up-Display (HUD) would make it feel more complete. 
        i. Active timer
       ii. Points system
      iii. Boost meter
       iv. Distance Traveled
    
    c. Better, more complete background art (a destroyed/post-apocalyptic cityscape)
    


4. What 2 parts of the game are fun? 

This type of game is not my favorite. That being said

    a. phasing is cool, however, cool-down is a little short and the pahased-out mode is a little long

    b. i like to be able to see how long i can make it before my game is over. My record is 35 seconds. 

5. What 2 parts of the game are tedious? 
  
    a. Getting from the left to the right in time to grab consecutive powerups. 

    b. the inablilty to deactivate phase-out before it expires on its own. 
        i. This could also be added to the answers of question 2. 
 



CHANGES MADE:
1. Changed obstacle from cube to a rough traffic cone i made in Maya
2. Added Trails to particle emission on powerup and change the color to green
