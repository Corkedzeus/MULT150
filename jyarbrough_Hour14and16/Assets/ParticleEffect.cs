/*
I was going for a blaster blaster bolt. 
I made changes to 6 different aspects, and would likely make other changes before implementing. I would actually create a blaster bolt sprite to use in place of the standard particle

ChangeS made:
-Scale X,Y changed to represent a blaster bolt
-Start speed increased to 100 
-Lifetime decreased to 1
-Color changed to blue (Ion blaser...great against droids) 
-Shape disabled
-Rate over time turned down to 2 (2 bolts per second)
    -if used in a game, would change this to 1 and have an option to switch to 3 rolt burst)
